The world ain’t big enough for the two of them. Armed with guns and roses, both players fight for the right to live in Asteroid A221. Le Petit Shooter is a third-person multiplayer-only shooter game between the “Relatively Small-Framed Prince” and the “Alien Wild Philosopher That Kind Of Resembles A Fox” in a deathmatch for territory.

With inspirations ranging from Wild West standoffs, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s The Little Prince, Worms, Towerfall and Lethal League, players fight each other on the surface of a small asteroid. Their bullets will keep orbiting the asteroid until they hit something. Using their “Somewhat Thorny Roses”, players can attack directly or reflect bullets.
